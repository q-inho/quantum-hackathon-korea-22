## Join IBM Quantum Challenge

Open an issue using the [`new project template`](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-hackathon-taiwan-20/issues/new?assignees=&labels=members+wanted&template=new-project-template.md&title=Project+name) template. Only issue at thie repo would be eligible to win the IBM Quantum Challenge.

Tag your project with `members wanted` and describe what kind of member are your searching for in the `Members` section.
At the beginning of the hackathon, the project should have no more than  members.

## My team is complete

Ask a Qiskit coach to remove the label `members wanted`.

## The project is ready. Let's hack!

After the project is defined and the team is complete, you can ask an IBMer to add the label `group ready`. This should happen before the group formation stage is finished, around noon of the first day. From this point on, you can use the issue to communicate progress as additional comments.

## The team needs a coach

A Qiskit coach guides and advices the team in its project.
Also will be your contact point after the hackathon, in case that the project have a continuation.
The team needs a coach before the final submission at the end of the hackathon.
